input=[1,2,3,4,5] rotate around 

output= [4,5,1,2,3]
* [Find missing number](find_missing_numbers.py)

find missing number between smallest and largest number in array which are not present in array

input=[1,1,1,4]
output=[2,3]

* [Three Largest Elements](three_largest_elements.py)

* [Majority Element](majority_element.py)

Find an element in an array which has most occurences
* [Find Sum](find_sum.py)

Find if sum of any elements in array is eqaul to a given number
* [Quick Sort](quick_sort.py)

### Implement Quick Sort algorithm

Quicksort Running Time:
Quick sort average case is O(n log n)
    each level takes O(n) but splitting the data is O(log n)
    O(n) * O(log n) = O(n log n)
Worse case is O(log n2)
    if pivot is smallest value, each level is O(n) and splitting the data is O(n)
    O(n) * O(n) = O(n2)

* [Union Sorted Array](union_sorted_array.py)

Perform Union operations on two arrays

 Find duplicate in an array of integers given that the integers are in random order and 
not necessarily each integer i is 0 <= i <= N where N = length of array
* [Product of Array Except Self](product_of_array_except_self.py)

find the product of all elements in an array 

* [Right Place](right_place.py)

Placing elements at right position in an array
* [Max Product Three Elements](max_product_three_elements.py)

Find out highest sum of three numbers in an array
* [Max Consecutive 1's](max_consecutive_ones.py)

Counts max number of one's in an array

* [Kadane Algorithm](kadane_algorithm.py)
